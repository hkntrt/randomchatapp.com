# randomchatapp.com

A failed website. It was up for a year and didn't get much traffic. It's a little experimental. Everything is done in vanilla JavaScript and Python/Flask.

If you decide to use it as a whole be sure to replace ssl certificate lines.
Sensitive informations are censored with "*******" such as email account. Provide your own to run it.

##### Features

* One on one chat
* Random match
* Contact Page (uses a trivial gmail account!)
* Voice Message
* Picture Message
* Responsive layout
* Service worker to support offline pages
* Uses sql to record text messages  (was required due to legal limitations.)
* Systemd service file to ease start/stop

Disclaimer: I didn't update anycode on this project since months! I am sure something will go wrong if you want to run it I am not even sure if that's the final version of the website.
